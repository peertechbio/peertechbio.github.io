# Editing and Review

Once the Peer team has created the new document, you can:
1. Access the **Kanban** or section-based view of the document
2. Perform **Chat** edits, **Manual** edits, or **Trace to Data** for verification

## 1. Chat
Leverage our AI-powered chat interface to:
- Make quick edits or content transformations (e.g., *“Convert this text to a table”*)
- Insert key messages or additional paragraphs
- Get suggestions to refine language or structure

### Use Case #1
**Placeholder**: “Video demonstrating how to convert a prose paragraph to an in-text table via the chat interface.”

### Use Case #2
**Placeholder**: “Video demonstrating how to insert a key message from the clinical team using the chat interface.”

### Use Case #3
**Placeholder**: “Video showing how to summarize or rephrase a large section of text with a single command.”

### Use Case #4
**Placeholder**: “Video showing how to restore previous versions or compare changes in real time.”

## 3. Trace to Data
To ensure accuracy, you can:
- **Click “Trace to Data”** next to any section
- View the original data sources (protocol, SAP, TLF, etc.) used by the AI
- Cross-check for correctness before finalizing
