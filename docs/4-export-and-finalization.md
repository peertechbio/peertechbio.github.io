# Export and Finalization

When your document is fully reviewed and approved:

1. **Apply Abbreviations & Hyperlinks**  
   The AI automatically checks for abbreviations and relevant hyperlinks.

2. **Final Consistency Check**  
   Ensures the document is consistent with the source data, final redlines are accepted (or rejected), and the final layout is correct.

3. **Export**  
   - Download as **.docx** (Word format)
   - *(Possible future formats: PDF, HTML, etc.)*

After export, you can open the final Word document to:
- Perform any last-minute formatting touches
- Share with regulatory authorities, clients, or other stakeholders
