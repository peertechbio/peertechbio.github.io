# Creating a New Document

## Build & Config Phase
In our initial rollout, the **Peer team** will create and configure the document for you. During this phase:
1. A new study/document project is created.
2. Relevant **document templates** are chosen (e.g., CSR, Narratives, Protocol, Plain Language Summary).
3. Required data sources (Protocol, SAP, TLF, etc.) are uploaded and processed by the AI engine.
4. The system auto-generates initial content for each section of your document.

> *You (the customer or medical writer) will typically begin working from the **Editing and Review** phase onward.*

## Document Types
Examples of supported document types:
- **Clinical Study Report (CSR)**
- **Narratives**
- **Protocol**
- **Plain Language Summary**
- *(Add or remove based on your needs)*

## Video Demo (Placeholder)
> We’ll embed a video here that shows the Peer team’s “Build & Config” process from start to finish.
