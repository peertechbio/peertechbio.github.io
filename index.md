# Peer Platform Documentation

Welcome to the **Peer Platform** documentation site!

Our platform empowers teams to:
- Create and configure new medical/clinical documents (e.g., **CSR**, **Narratives**, **Protocols**, **Plain Language Summaries**, etc.)
- **Build & Configure** documents (done by the Peer team initially)
- Allow customers and medical writers to **edit and review** using advanced AI-assisted features (chat-based editing, manual edits, and data traceability)
- **Finalize and export** the completed documents in multiple formats
